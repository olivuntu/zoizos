The conspicuous ecological changes that occur along elevational gradients have drawn the attention of an increasing number of studies. Most hypotheses which attempted to explain biological responses to elevational gradients were formally based on a single bio-physical factor such as productivity, habitat diversity, environmental stress, resource availability or competition (e.g. Rahbek, 1995; Heaney, 2001). Others underlined the role of anthropogenic pressure or ecological and evolutionary processes (e.g. Myers \& Giller, 1988). 

Surprisingly, studies on species distribution along elevational gradients scarcely pay attention to the status of the involved species, i.e. either exotic or native, despite of the increased importance of the impact of introduced species on biodiversity (Vitousek et al., 1997). The same can be said of studies on latitudinal gradients (but see Sax, 2001). Considering the theoretical framework of biological invasions, investigations on the distribution of exotic species along broad ecological gradients should enable us to predict invasion patterns. 


Birds, widely introduced throughout the world and having colonized most vegetation types (Long, 1981), are a relevant taxon for studying the comparative distribution of exotic versus native species along elevational gradients. Exotics are species that have been introduced by humans, or have been able to expand their range because of anthropogenic disturbances, into geographical regions in which they were not historically present (Sax, 2001). Birds have been widely used as models in studies on the variation of species richness with elevation (Thiollay, 1980; Patterson et al., 1998; Benning et al., 2002 ; Prodon et al., 2002). The elevational range of bird communities is also of special interest as it is one of the dimensions of the niche of a species, and it is linked to flexibility in habitat or food choices, ability to coexist with different species, and physiological tolerance (Prodon et al., 2002). % Last, the mean elevational position can be considered to be an indicator for determining one of the optimal vegetation types of a species. 


In this paper, we use past data to document the elevational patterns of bird assemblages on a tropical volcanic island.  We specifically adress the question whether elevational distribution patterns differ between exotic and native bird species. We analyse patterns along a slope on Reunion Island (Indian Ocean) that presents one of the widest bio-climatic gradients within any oceanic island, \textit{i.e.} from 0 to more than 3000 m on a distance of 20 km. We first characterize species distribution along the gradient and compare distribution parameters across native and exotic species. We then characterize patterns of species richness and compare the observed patterns to two different nul models. 

Analysing observed patterns relatively to nul models expectations can inform on assembly processes. Nul models differ in the way they assemble community data, that is species occurrence data, here abundance, in sampled sites. They can include several constraints which consist in preserving some properties of the observed data, such as species overall abundance or local abundance at each sampled site. Here, the two tested models assemble species randomly preserving their frequency along the gradient, in order to retain differences in rarity. The first model is constrained by the total abundance of birds observed locally that is held constant during estimation. The model thus conserves interactions between total abundance and the environment, which can be referred to as the 'site capacity hypothesis'. 


This capacity is supposed to be mobilized by birds present to some constant level, which is reflected in the total estimated abundance. 

In the second model, these interactions are suppressed supposing that site capacity varies randomly. In this model, the sites are supposed as equal in their capacity to support birds to some random level. 

Comparing observed data with nul models allows to explore differences in the elevational patterns of species richness between native and exotic birds under the constraint of observed commonness and site capacity or not.
